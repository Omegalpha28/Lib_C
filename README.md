>> my_char_is_printable = This function checks if a character is printable (not a control character), returning 0 if it is, and 1 otherwise.
>> my_compute_factorial_it = This function calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer the number given iteratively and computing the factorial for values between 1 and 12. For values outside this range, it returns 0.
>> my_compute_factorial_rec = Same as the previous one but implemented recursively.
>> my_compute_power_it = This function calculates the number given raised to the power of p iteratively. It returns 0 for negative powers or when the result overflows the integer range. For non-negative powers, it computes the result, returning 1 for p equal to 0 and 0 if the number given is 0.
>> my_compute_power_rec = Same as the previous one but implemented recursively.
>> my_compute_square_root = This function calculates the square root of a non-negative integer using an iterative approach. It returns the integer square root if it exists, and 0 if nb is negative or not a perfect square. Special case: it returns 1 if the number given is 1.
>> my_find_prime_sup = This function finds the smallest prime number greater than or equal to nb. It uses "using_task06" to check for primality, incrementing number until a prime number is found, then returns that prime number.
>> my_is_prine = This function determines if nb is a prime number. It returns 1 if nb is prime and 0 otherwise. It handles special cases for even numbers and numbers less than 2, and it uses wh_is_prime to check for divisibility by numbers starting from 3.
>> my_str_to_word_array = This function, takes a string word and splits it into an array of words. Each word is separated by spaces or tabs, and the resulting array of words is returned.
numlen = The function is intended to return the number of digits in the integer n, including handling negative numbers.
>> skip_spaces = The function skip_spaces is designed to skip over leading spaces and tab characters in a string, returning a pointer to the first non-whitespace character or the end of the string if it only contains whitespace.
>> skipstr = The function is intended to skip over a portion of a string up to a specified delimiter and then optionally handle a newline character. 
>> word_counter = The word_counter function is designed to count the number of words in a string based on spaces as delimiters.
